        <h1>Korean Basic Grammar</h1>

        <h2>Korean Alphabet – Learn the Hangul Letters</h2>
        <p>In this lesson, you’re going to learn the Korean alphabet in only 30 minutes using visual associations,
            mnemonics, and stories.</p>
        <p>That means you will be able to read the Korean alphabet letters A to Z and start sounding out Korean words
            anytime you see them. You may be surprised how often you see Korean characters!</p>

        <h3>Hangul – The Korean Alphabet</h3>
        <p>The official writing system for South Korea is Hangul (한글), which is the name for the Korean Alphabet system.
            That means you can say Hangul and Korean alphabet interchangeably since they mean the same thing.
            Korean is the official language of South Korea, and it uses Hangul as its alphabet and writing system. The
            same writing system is used in North Korea which is called Joseongeul (조선글). Both South Korea and North
            Korea use the writing system created by King Sejong the Great.</p>

        <h3>Hangul in Korean</h3>
        <p>Hangul in Korean is 한글 (hangeul). Hangul is also written in English as “Hangeul”. There are two different
            ways of spelling the same word. “Hangul” is the most common way, and “Hangeul” is the newer way of writing
            it.</p>

        <h3>Hangul Meaning</h3>
        <p>The word Hangul comes from the Chinese characters 韓㐎. “Han” means “Korean”, and “gul” means “letter”. Put
            them together, and you’ve got the term “Korean letter”, or “Korean Alphabet”.</p>

        <h3>Korean Alphabet Structure</h3>
        <p>Since Hangul is a very scientific alphabet. It’s one of the best writing systems for beginners to learn who
            don’t know any Korean. It’s also quite easy to write in Hangul since the letters follow a basic order.

            Did you know that there are fewer letters in the Korean alphabet than there are letters in the English
            alphabet?</p>

        <h3>The Korean Alphabet has 14 consonants and 10 vowels.</h3>

        <p>Unlike Japanese or Chinese, which have thousands of characters and each can have 10, 15, or more strokes, the
            most complex Korean character in the alphabet can be written using only five strokes. That makes learning
            both Hangul and Korean quite easy.

            On top of this, the Korean language has a grammar structure that can be mastered by understanding some basic
            rules. This makes Korean a great language for learning quickly and easily.

            It all starts with knowing the Hangul (Korean alphabet) – the basic building blocks of the language.

            Hangul is a very scientific writing system. It was developed with precision in mind about 500 years ago by
            King Sejong the Great. The Korean writing system before it was created used classical Chinese characters.
            Only those who are educated are able to read and write using the old Korean writing system. As a result,
            King Sejong wanted to give Koreans a practical way of reading and writing to promote literacy.

        </p>

        <p>Throughout this page, we’ll use the terms Korean letter and Korean character interchangeably. People tend to
            use them both when they learn Hangul, so you can use either one. </p>
        <h3>How to Learn the Korean Alphabet</h3>
        <p>This Korean alphabet lesson makes use of psychological techniques to help make learning Hangul fun and easy.
            Namely, it uses associations and stories to help everything stick in your brain so you can’t forget it.

            This lesson covers the Korean alphabet A to Z, broken down and simplified so you can begin speaking right
            away. There is audio to help your pronunciation with Hangul.</p>
        <h3>The Korean Consonants</h3>

        <p>Hangul (the Korean Alphabet) has both consonants and vowels just like English.

            Let’s learn the consonants in the Korean alphabet to start.

            First, let’s take a look at the English alphabet. Instead of looking at the actual letters, let’s just look
            at the sounds they make.

            In doing so, we can find the closest equivalents in the Korean alphabet so that we can start to make
            associations to learn the Hangul letters.

            In Korean, there are no F, R, V, or Z sounds, so let’s take them out.</p>
